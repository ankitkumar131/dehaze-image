# Image Dehazing System Presentation

## Introduction
- Advanced image dehazing system combining traditional and deep learning approaches
- Addresses visibility issues in outdoor computer vision applications
- Integrates physics-based and learning-based methods

> Speaker Notes:
Welcome everyone. Today I'll present our image dehazing system that combines traditional computer vision techniques with modern deep learning approaches. Our system addresses a critical challenge in outdoor vision applications where atmospheric conditions like haze and fog degrade image quality.

## Problem Statement
- Atmospheric scattering degrades image quality
- Existing methods have limitations in real-world scenarios
- Need for robust, real-time dehazing solution

> Speaker Notes:
The core problem we're addressing is image degradation caused by atmospheric scattering. While existing solutions exist, they often struggle with real-world scenarios. Our goal was to develop a more robust and practical solution that works in real-time.

## Literature Review
- Traditional methods: Dark Channel Prior
- Deep learning approaches: CNN-based solutions
- Hybrid techniques combining multiple approaches

> Speaker Notes:
Our research built upon existing work in the field, including traditional methods like Dark Channel Prior and modern deep learning solutions. We analyzed their strengths and limitations to inform our hybrid approach.

## Research Methodology
- Dual-stream architecture
- Enhanced Dark Channel Prior implementation
- U-Net based deep learning model
- Video processing extension

> Speaker Notes:
We developed a dual-stream architecture that combines enhanced Dark Channel Prior with a U-Net deep learning model. This approach allows us to leverage the best of both worlds while adding video processing capabilities.

## Flow Chart

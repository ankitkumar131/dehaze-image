# 20-Minute Presentation Script: Image Dehazing Project

## Slide 1-2: Introduction (3 minutes)

**Person 1**: Good morning everyone. Today we're presenting our image dehazing project that addresses a critical problem in computer vision and photography - the degradation of image quality due to atmospheric haze.

**Person 2**: Let me start by showing you some examples of how haze affects images. Notice the reduced visibility, faded colors, and loss of contrast in these outdoor scenes. <mcreference link="https://slideplayer.com/slide/14619170/" index="4">4</mcreference>

## Slide 3-5: Problem Background (4 minutes)

**Person 1**: Why is haze removal important? Poor visibility in hazy images affects:
- Consumer photography quality
- Object detection systems
- Video surveillance performance
- Computer vision applications <mcreference link="https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13640-016-0104-y" index="5">5</mcreference>

**Person 2**: The challenge lies in solving what we call an ill-posed inverse problem. We need to recover the original clear image from a single hazy input, which is mathematically complex.

## Slide 6-8: Technical Approach (5 minutes)

**Person 1**: Our solution uses the Dark Channel Prior method. This approach is based on a key observation: in most non-sky regions of haze-free outdoor images, at least one color channel has very low intensity values.

**Person 2**: Let me explain our implementation steps:
1. Calculate the dark channel from input image
2. Estimate atmospheric light
3. Compute transmission map
4. Recover the haze-free image

## Slide 9-11: Implementation Details (4 minutes)

**Person 1**: We've made several improvements to the basic algorithm:
- Refined transmission estimation for bright regions
- Adaptive patch size selection
- Enhanced sky region processing to prevent color distortion <mcreference link="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Single-Image-Dehazing-Algorithm-Based-on-Dark-Prior-Zhou-Bai/15710a27338c90e9c03b3ad494f06d72b8cb93e6" index="3">3</mcreference>

**Person 2**: Our GUI implementation features:
- Real-time processing feedback
- Side-by-side comparison view
- Interactive zoom and pan capabilities

## Slide 12-14: Results and Evaluation (3 minutes)

**Person 1**: Let's look at our results across different scenarios:
- Various haze densities
- Different lighting conditions
- Complex scenes with both near and far objects

**Person 2**: We evaluate our results based on:
- Visual quality improvement
- Processing time efficiency
- Performance in computer vision tasks <mcreference link="https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13640-016-0104-y" index="5">5</mcreference>

## Slide 15: Conclusion (1 minute)

**Person 1**: To summarize, our implementation:
- Successfully removes haze from single images
- Provides a user-friendly interface
- Maintains good performance across various conditions

**Person 2**: Thank you for your attention. We welcome any questions about our implementation or results.
